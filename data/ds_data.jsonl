To derive the Customer NPS, we start with the percentage of \u201a\u00c4\u00fapromoters\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (those giving us a score of 9 or 10).

During the training phase, the demand forecast engine computes the influence of historical aspects such as promotions, calendar events, seasonality, price elasticity, and the presence of cannibalizing products extracted from the historical data. Then, depending on the user's goal, baseline or total volume forecasts are provided on-request for a selection of products sold at a defined (sell-out) price, during a particular period at a specified retailer/account. Promotion details are taken into account should there be any.

The calculations are driven by its present abilities, as of February 2024.\n It is anticipated that S/4HANA Condition Contract Management Implementation and setup will be accomplished before the implementation of the IC RGM. The estimation process considers the necessary set-ups and configurations to facilitate the integration of IC RGM with the S4 Condition Contract Management solution.\n The implementation efforts are based off rolling out the RGM solution to two regions which include CA and US, and the capabilities as it exists as off Feb 2024. \n For the baseline forecast optimization Go-Live - SAP recommends focusing on 3~4 accounts for baseline forecasting based on syndicated data, then roll-out gradually into other accounts and layer on-optimization in the next phase of implementation. The current estimates do not consider on-boarding of more than 3~4 accounts per region and includes the estimation for forecasting the optimized baseline.\n Continuous knowledge transfer to customer data scientist team to ensure data pipelines and forecast accuracy can be maintained after Go-Live.  /"}
